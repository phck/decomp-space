# Decomposition spaces

This is an in-progress, introductory account of some basics of decomposition spaces.
It is primarily based on [my introductory talk](https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5266/videos/watch/202401221031-Hackney.html) at the BIRS workshop [Higher Segal Spaces and their Applications](https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5266) in January 2024.
Material in the final section is drawn from [my second talk](https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5266/videos/watch/202401260946-Hackney.html).

Feedback or suggestions are very much appreciated.
Be warned that things may change substantially during development!
